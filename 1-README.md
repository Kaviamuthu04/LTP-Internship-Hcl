This repository contains my Linux Test Project (LTP) internship work at HCL Technologies.

- Sample **log files** from memory and file system tests
- Simple **scripts** to run common test cases automatically
- Screenshots showing successful build and run

## Purpose
This repo will help you understand the LTP setup and testing process clearly, and continue expanding the tests and analysis.
